# Herd

Herd is an in-progress, easy-to-use framework for management
of small-scale server clusters in pure python.
Tools like puppet, chef, etc seem to target more large-scale systems, and in my
experience aren't great for getting some small, dead simple machines and apps
going.

In addition, Herd aims to provide a simple framework for creating and handling
your nodes across multiple cloud providers, to help limit and manage your
server costs. :)
