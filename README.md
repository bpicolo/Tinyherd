# Herd

Herd is an in-progress, easy-to-use framework for management
of small-scale server clusters. Tools like puppet, chef, etc target
more large-scale systems.

In addition, Herd aims to provide a simple framework for creating and handling
your nodes across multiple cloud providers, to help limit and manage your
server costs. :)
